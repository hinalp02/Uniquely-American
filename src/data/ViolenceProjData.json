Card also got a pair of hearing aids in February, and his brother said this seemed to distress him. There was a different Robert Card on the Maine sex offender registry, and it's possible this was a trigger for him. In the two months leading up to the shooting, Card isolated himself from his Army Reserve group, not attending monthly trainings. He assaulted his best friend of 17 years, who then reported him to supervisors because he feared Card would commit a mass shooting. ",
