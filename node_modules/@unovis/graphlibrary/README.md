# @unovis/graphlibrary
    ℹ️ This version of Graphlibrary is a fork of https://github.com/tylingsoft/graphlibrary,
    which is a fork of the original `graphlib` package (https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib).

    We've created this fork to update the code to ES modules and use individual lodash-es imports
    to allow better tree shaking in Unovis.

    If you want to learn more about the changes, check our Releases section on GitHub:
    https://github.com/unovis/graphlibrary/releases/

Graphlibrary is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for undirected
and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used with them.

To learn more see the original `graphlib`'s Wiki: https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib/wiki.
