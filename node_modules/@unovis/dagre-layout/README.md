# @unovis/dagre-layout - Graph layout for JavaScript
    ℹ️ This version of Graphlibrary is a fork of https://github.com/tylingsoft/dagre-layout,
    which is a fork of the original `dagre` package (https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre).

    We've created this fork to update the code to ES modules and use individual lodash-es imports
    to allow better tree shaking in Unovis.

    If you want to learn more about the changes, check our Releases section on GitHub:
    https://github.com/unovis/dagre-layout/releases/

Dagre is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on the client-side.

For more details, including examples and configuration options, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre/wiki).
